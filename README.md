## Greet me

Write a method called `greet` that takes one argument as name and then greets that name, capitalized and ends with an exclamation point.

Examples:

```
greet("maya") // returns "Hello Maya!"
greet("JACK") // returns "Hello Jack!"
```

## Trolls

Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function called `neutralize` that takes a string and returns a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string `"This website is for losers LOL!"` would become `"Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!"`.


## Boiled Eggs

You are the greatest chef on earth. No one boils eggs like you! Your restaurant is always full of guests, who love your boiled eggs. But when there is a greater order of boiled eggs, you need some time, because you have only one pot for your job. How much time do you need?

Implement a function called `cookingTime`, which takes a non-negative integer, representing the number of eggs to boil. It must return the time in minutes (integer), which it takes to have all the eggs boiled.

Rules:

* you can put at most 8 eggs into the pot at once
* it takes 5 minutes to boil an egg
* we assume, that the water is boiling all the time (no time to heat up)
* for simplicity we also don't consider the time it takes to put eggs into the pot or get them out of it

Examples:

You need 0 minutes to cook 0 eggs

You need 5 minutes to cook 3 eggs

You need 10 minutes to cook 9 eggs
