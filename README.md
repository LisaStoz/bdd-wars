## Greet me

Write a method called `greet` that takes one argument as name and then greets that name, capitalized and ends with an exclamation point.

Examples:

```
greet("maya") // returns "Hello Maya!"
greet("JACK") // returns "Hello Jack!"
```

## Trolls

Trolls are attacking your comment section!

A common way to deal with this situation is to remove all of the vowels from the trolls' comments, neutralizing the threat.

Your task is to write a function called `neutralize` that takes a string and returns a new string with all vowels removed.

For example, the string `"This website is for losers LOL!"` would become `"Ths wbst s fr lsrs LL!"`.
